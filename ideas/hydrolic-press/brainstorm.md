# Brainstorm: Casual Hydraulic Press Mobile Game

## Core Idea
Create a **casual mobile game** centered around using a **hydraulic press** to crush, deform, and transform various objects in the most **satisfying way possible**. The game builds on the massive popularity of hydraulic press videos on TikTok and YouTube Shorts — where audiences find crushing objects to be **oddly relaxing, fascinating, and addicting**.

The goal is simple yet engaging:
> 📌 *Place, align, and activate the press to achieve the most satisfying outcome.*

Player satisfaction is driven by:
- Visual ASMR-style deformation
- Realistic physics behavior
- Sound design (crunch, crack, squish, snap)
- Perfect alignment bonus

---

## Genre & Style
- **Genre:** Casual / Simulation / ASMR / Physics-based
- **Perspective:** Top-down / slight isometric / cinematic side-view
- **Target Audience:** 10–35 years old, TikTok / Shorts / mobile-game users
- **Session length:** 1–3 minutes per level

---

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. Player is given an object (or multiple objects)
2. They must **place / rotate / align** the object correctly
3. Tap or hold to **activate the hydraulic press**
4. Watch the deformation in real-time
5. Receive a **Satisfaction Score** (based on how perfect it was)
6. Unlock next object or mode

Optional: Replay level to get a *Perfect Press*

## Physics & Satisfaction Mechanics
This is the CORE of the game.

### Physics requirements:
- Soft body physics for squishy items (fruit, toys, slime)
- Hard body physics for solid items (metal, wood, stone)
- Fracture/shatter system (glass, ceramics)
- Particle and debris system
- Slow-motion during critical moments

### Satisfaction rating based on:
- Centered placement
- Clean / symmetrical deformation
- No slipping / bouncing out
- Sound + visual intensity

Score Ratings:
- ❌ Messy Press
- ✅ Good Press
- ⭐ Perfect Press
- 💎 Hyper-Satisfying
